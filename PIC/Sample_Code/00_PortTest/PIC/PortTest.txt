This program iterates through the pins on the PIC, making the debug LEDs toggle 
sequentially.

A few notes:
 1. Below the LED array in the debug module, there is a DIP switch called "LED 
    DEBUG". When one of these switches is turned ON (up position), the 
    corresponding column of LEDs will be enabled.

 2. Preconditions are described in main.c. These are:
    2.1) No external circuitry driving the data lines
    2.2) LED debug switches are all enabled
    2.3) Debug DIP switches are all in the middle position
    2.4) Arduino-PIC link switches are all OFF
    2.5) JP_TX and JP_RX in the USB module are open (i.e. not shorted)
    2.6) The A2D jumpers are open (i.e. not connected to the PIC)
    2.7) The PRG/RUN switch must be in the RUN position (this is assumed for ALL
         sample code)
