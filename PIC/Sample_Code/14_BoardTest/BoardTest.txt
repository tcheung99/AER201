This program tests the basic capabilities of the development board. The keypad
is used to select which functionality will be tested.

CAUTION: each of these functions requires a specific jumper configuration before
being used. Improper jumper configurations may damage the development board.
Please refer to the other sample programs for specifics on how the board should 
be configured prior to running each test.

KEY     FUNCTION

1       Sets the time on the RTC

2       Reads the time from the RTC

3       Initializes the GLCD and draws two rectangles

4       Initializes the SD card and displays the storage capacity. NOTE: if
        there is no SD card inserted, this function will never finish

5       Iterates through the I/O. PIC must be reset to exit this function

6       Sends "Hello world!" on the UART bus, which can be received by a PC
        through the USB module when the Co-processor is booted into the virtual 
        COM port program

7       Acquires analog data from RA2 and RA3 and displays the results on the 
        character LCD in hexadecimal format
