SD cards are capable of storing large amounts of memory in a "non-volatile" 
fashion, meaning that the information is preserved even when power is turned off
(this relies on floating-gate MOSFET technology). A SD card is a slave device,
and so it is communicated with my sending it commands as the master. When a SD
card is first powered up, it will be unresponsive to any commands until it is
initialized. Initialization is a "handshake" that is highly specific; in fact,
all commands are sufficiently specific that there is a specification detailing
how to implement them. The implementation in this sample code follows the SD 
Physical Layer Simplified Specification Version 6.00.

In this sample, initialization is performed, during which time certain 
card-specific data is retrieved. Some examples are the storage capacity of the 
card, the manufacturer ID, the date the card was manufactured, and the SD spec.
version the card controller complies to. These details are printed to the 
character LCD.
