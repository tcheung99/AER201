This program uses the PIC's Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) module to read the
voltage signal on pins RA2 and RA3.

The 2 potentiometers in the A2D section can be used to provide the ADC with a 
voltage reference. The 2 jumper links connect the Vref+ and Vref- 
potientiometers to RA3 and RA2, respectively.

C VERSION:
The results of the ADC are displayed on the character LCD in hexadecimal 
representation. The total conversion output is 10 bits ranging from 0x000 to 
0x3ff. The leftmost digit refers to the most significant 2 bits stored in 
ADRESH, and the 2 following letters are the hexadecimal representation of the 
lower byte of the A2D conversion result, stored in ADRESL.

ASSEMBLY VERSION:
The results of the lowest 8 bits of the ADC (i.e. ADRESL) are displayed on the 
pins of the PIC, and can be seen easily on the debug module LEDs. PORTC 
corresponds to the signal on RA3, and PORTD corresponds to the signal on RA2.
