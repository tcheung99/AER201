This is a sample program for arbitrary information exchange between the main PIC
and the Arduino Nano via UART; the PIC sends the character ":) " to the Arduino 
Nano. To see the results on the Arduino Nano side, program the the Arduino 
sample program "Arduino_UART_PIC" into the Arduino, and follow the instructions 
contained in that file.

Note: preconditions for this code to work properly are as follows:
    1. The Co-processor is not driving lines on the UART bus (e.g. the JP_TX
       and JP_RX jumpers are removed)
    2. The character LCD is in an Arduino Nano socket
    3. PIC-Arduino link switches are enabled (ON) for D1 of the Arduino (the RX
       pin). However, make sure that neither of D0 and D1 are enabled (ON) 
       while programming the Arduino Nano
