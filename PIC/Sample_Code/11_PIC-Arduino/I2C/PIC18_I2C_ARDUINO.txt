This code is a demonstration of I2C communication between the PIC18F4620 and 
Arduino Nano. This same procedure could be generalized to a larger number of
devices.

Instructions:

1. Move all Arduino-PIC link switches to the OFF (down) position except for 
   switch 1 and 2 on the lower bank (S3). This will enable the I2C connection 
   between the Arduino Nano and PIC (A4 and A5 pin for the Arduino Nano, RC4
   and RC3 for the PIC)

2. Load the PIC sample program onto the main PIC as you would normally

3. Plug in an Arduino Nano to the computer using a USB A to Mini-B cable

4. Open "Arduino_I2C_PIC.ino" in the Arduino IDE, and select "Arduino Nano" for 
   the board, and "ATmega328" for the processor. In Tools, choose the new COM 
   port that appeared after the Arduino Nano was plugged in (you may need to 
   remove and re-attach the Arduino Nano to check)

5. Upload the Arduino Nano code to the Arduino Nano board and open the serial 
   monitor from the Arduino IDE

6. Plug the Arduino Nano into the "Arduino Nano Board" socket on the PIC 
   Devbugger. BE CAREFUL to align the Arduino with the USB cable pointing out of
   the board, and the leftmost position of the socket unoccupied. The socket on
   the Devbugger is 16 positions wide while the Arduino Nano has 15 pins on each
   side. The pins labeled "N.C." should remain unconnected

7. After the Arduino Nano is properly connected to the Devbugger, the serial 
   monitor should display the values input by the keypad

8. To reverse the direction of data and let the PIC recieve data sent from the 
   Arduino Nano, press the letter "A" on the keypad 3 times ("AAA"). The PIC 
   will now enter reciever mode, and characters sent to the Arduino Nano through
   the serial monitor will now be displayed on the LCD onboard the DevBugger

9. To revert back to PIC -> Arduino communication, reset the PIC using the reset
   button on the board
