This code demonstrates reading keypad data and displaying it on the character 
LCD. Upon startup, the LCD will display the character corresponding to the key 
pressed on the keypad. Unlike the other 2 keypad sample programs, this program 
receives the key press data via the UART module, which means PORTB is free.

NOTE: the co-processor must be running in its UART keypad encoder mode for this 
demonstration to work.

NOTE: the PRG/RUN switch must be switched to "RUN" in order for keypad input to 
work properly, since the keypad encoder shares pins with the programmer.
