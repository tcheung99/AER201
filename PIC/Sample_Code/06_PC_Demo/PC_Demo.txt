This program demonstrates PIC-PC communication. It sends key press data to a PC 
connected to the co-processor, while also displaying data received from the PC 
to the character LCD.

Note: the co-processor must be booted into the program where it is running the 
virtual COM port. Also, the jumpers in the USB module must be shorted to enable 
PIC-PC communication.
