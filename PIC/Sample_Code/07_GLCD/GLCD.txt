A graphical LCD (or GLCD) is able to display arbitrary images by addressing 
pixels with specific color values. This sample program initializes a 
ST7735R-based GLCD, and demonstrates the fundamental graphics "function", 
drawing rectangles. Drawing pixels are also demonstrated as a special case of 
drawing rectangles.

Note that the GLCD must be placed in the PIC socket (the bottom GLCD socket) for
this program.

NOTE:
The GLCD's red PCB will have a version number printed on the back. For this demo
to work properly, you must make sure the correct version number macro is 
defined (i.e. in GLCD_PIC.h, either V1_1 or V2_1 should be defined in the macros
section). Currently, versions 1.1 and 2.1 are supported by this demo.
